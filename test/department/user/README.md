# PTE Framework Test Case Classification Description

## Overview

The test cases in the `test/department/user` directory are divided into two main categories:
1. **Framework Demo Tests** - Demonstrates core functionality and features of the PTE framework
2. **Business Case Tests** - Actual business scenario test cases

## Test Classification

### 1. Framework Demo Tests (Framework Demo Tests)

These test cases are mainly used to demonstrate the core functionality of the PTE framework and help developers understand how to use the framework.

  - Business operations functionality demonstration
  - Test data functionality demonstration
  - Environment switching functionality demonstration
  - Framework integration functionality demonstration
  - Error handling functionality demonstration
  - Framework extensibility demonstration

#### 1.2 Configuration Management Demonstration
- **File**: `demo_config_management.py`
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates the configuration management functionality of the PTE framework
- **Content**:
  - YAML configuration loading demonstration
  - Environment switching functionality demonstration
  - Configuration loader functionality demonstration

#### 1.3 Database Functionality Demonstration
- **File**: `demo_database_features.py`
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates the database functionality of the PTE framework
- **Content**:
  - Database connection demonstration
  - SQL building functionality demonstration
  - Table operations functionality demonstration
  - Data operations functionality demonstration
  - Database assertion functionality demonstration
  - User-specific operations demonstration
  - SQLAlchemy integration demonstration
  - Database configuration demonstration
  - Error handling demonstration
  - Database performance demonstration

### 2. Business Case Tests (Business Cases)

These test cases simulate real business scenarios and are used to verify the correctness of business logic.

#### 2.1 User Management Business Scenarios
- **File**: `business_user_management.py`
- **Purpose**: Test user management related business scenarios
- **Content**:
  - Complete user registration workflow
  - Complete user profile update workflow
  - Complete user deletion workflow
  - Complete user search and filtering workflow
  - Complete user data validation workflow
  - Complete user batch operations workflow
  - Complete user error handling workflow
  - Complete user performance testing workflow

## Test Execution Guide

### Running Framework Demo Tests

```bash
# Run framework structure demonstration
pytest test/department/user/demo_framework_structure.py -v

# Run configuration management demonstration
pytest test/department/user/demo_config_management.py -v

# Run database functionality demonstration
pytest test/department/user/demo_database_features.py -v
```

### Running Business Case Tests

```bash
# Run user management business scenarios
pytest test/department/user/business_user_management.py -v
```

### Running All Demo Tests

```bash
# Run all framework demo tests
pytest test/department/user/demo_*.py -v
```

### Running All Business Case Tests

```bash
# Run all business case tests
pytest test/department/user/business_*.py -v
```

## Test Case Design Principles

### Framework Demo Test Design Principles

1. **Educational**: Test cases should help developers understand how to use the framework
2. **Completeness**: Cover all core functionality of the framework
3. **Clarity**: Test case naming and comments should be clear and easy to understand
4. **Independence**: Each test case should run independently without depending on other test cases
5. **Repeatability**: Test cases should be repeatable with consistent results

### Business Case Test Design Principles

1. **Authenticity**: Simulate real business scenarios
2. **Completeness**: Cover complete business workflows
3. **Robustness**: Include normal and abnormal workflows
4. **Performance**: Include performance-related tests
5. **Maintainability**: Test cases should be easy to maintain and extend

## Test Data Management

### Demo Test Data
- Use mock data, not dependent on real environment
- Data should be simple and clear, easy to understand
- Each test case uses independent data

### Business Case Test Data
- Use real business data formats
- Include various boundary cases and exception cases
- Automatically clean up data after test completion

## Environment Configuration

### Test Environment Setup
```bash
# Set test environment
export TEST_IDC=local_test
export TEST_ENV=local
```

### Database Environment
- Use Docker MySQL for testing
- Automatically create test database and tables
- Automatically insert test data

## Important Notes

1. **Demo Tests**: Mainly for learning and demonstration, do not contain complex business logic
2. **Business Case Tests**: Contain real business scenarios, need careful test case design
3. **Data Cleanup**: Business case tests automatically clean up test data after completion
4. **Environment Isolation**: Different test cases use independent environment configurations
5. **Performance Considerations**: Business case tests include performance-related validations

## Extension Guide

### Adding New Demo Tests

1. Create new test file with naming format `demo_*.py`
2. Inherit appropriate test base class
3. Add clear test case comments
4. Ensure test cases are independent and repeatable

### Adding New Business Case Tests

1. Create new test file with naming format `business_*.py`
2. Design real business scenarios
3. Include complete business workflow tests
4. Add data cleanup logic
5. Include exception case handling

## Summary

Through this classification approach, we can:
- Clearly distinguish between framework demonstrations and business tests
- Facilitate new developers' learning and understanding of the framework
- Ensure correctness of business logic
- Improve maintainability of test cases
- Support different levels of testing requirements
